The purpose of VoiceRemote:

  * Allow high level Quadriplegics without finger dexterity to control an Android device.
  * Immediately begin listening for commands when the headset button or bluetooth button is pressed. A simple button can be place anywhere that's comfortable such as a wheelchair headrest.
